# Fine-tuned TinyLlama Model Deployment Summary

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

### 1. Model Training
- Successfully fine-tuned TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 on MakeMyTrip financial QA dataset
- Used LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning
- Training completed with 10 epochs, saved checkpoints available

### 2. Model Upload to Hugging Face Hub
- **Repository**: `kundan621/tinyllama-makemytrip-financial-qa`
- **URL**: https://huggingface.co/kundan621/tinyllama-makemytrip-financial-qa
- Model includes:
  - Fine-tuned adapter weights
  - Tokenizer configuration
  - Comprehensive model card with usage instructions
  - License: Apache 2.0

### 3. Streamlit App Integration
- Updated `streamlit_app.py` to support both RAG and Fine-tuned modes
- Added model loading with caching for better performance
- Integrated response generation using the fine-tuned model
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Created test script (`test_fine_tuned_model.py`) to validate model performance
- Verified model generates relevant financial information about MakeMyTrip
- Average response time: 1-4 seconds per question

## üöÄ How to Use

### Running the Streamlit App
```bash
cd /Users/kundankumar/Documents/CAI
/Users/kundankumar/Documents/CAI/.venv/bin/python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### App Features
1. **RAG Mode**: Uses existing retrieval-augmented generation pipeline
2. **Fine-Tuned Mode**: Uses the uploaded TinyLlama model for responses
3. **Confidence Scores**: Displays confidence for each response
4. **Response Time**: Shows generation time for performance monitoring

### Model Performance Examples
- ‚úÖ Revenue queries: "MakeMyTrip's total revenue for 2020 was Rs 2,828.59 crore"
- ‚úÖ Marketing spend: "INR 1,360.13 million on marketing in FY 2019-20"
- ‚úÖ Business segments: Detailed breakdown of travel agency operations
- ‚úÖ Customer base: "Over 20 million customers every year"

## üìÅ Updated Files

### New Files
- `upload_model_to_hf.py` - Script to upload model to Hugging Face
- `test_fine_tuned_model.py` - Testing script for model validation
- `fine_tuned_tinyllama_makemytrip/` - Local model directory

### Modified Files
- `streamlit_app.py` - Added fine-tuned model integration
- `requirements.txt` - Added `peft` and `huggingface_hub` dependencies
- `Fine_Tuning_TinyLlama.ipynb` - Added model upload cell

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Create a .env file with your Hugging Face token
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_token_here
# Note: Keep your actual token secure and never commit it
```

### Key Dependencies
- `transformers` - For model loading and tokenization
- `peft` - For LoRA adapter loading
- `huggingface_hub` - For model download/upload
- `torch` - For model inference
- `streamlit` - For web interface

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Model Optimization**: Consider quantization for faster inference
2. **UI Improvements**: Add model comparison features
3. **Monitoring**: Implement logging for user interactions
4. **Scaling**: Consider deploying to cloud platforms for public access

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Model Size**: ~2.89MB (adapter only)
- **Loading Time**: ~3.2 seconds
- **Inference Time**: 0.65-4.02 seconds per response
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for CPU inference
